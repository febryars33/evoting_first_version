## IMPORTANT
This application is proprietary and non-commercial, except by the creator. Although this is built with several tools, frameworks, and so on, for example the Laravel Framework which applies the MIT license to its framework. Therefore I was able to make it commercial. you can read about the MIT license https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.
Once again I do not commercialize the Framework, tools or anything else but only the applications that I make.
